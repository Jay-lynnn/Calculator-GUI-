# Calculator GUI ðŸ§®

This is my very first GUI calculator made with Python and Tkinter. It can:
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide
- Handle errors (try dividing by 0, I dare you ðŸ˜¤)
- Clear all with **AC**
- Backspace with **âŒ«**
- Use decimal points (American style ðŸ˜…)

I built this while learning how to make GUI apps â€” itâ€™s messy but it works.
